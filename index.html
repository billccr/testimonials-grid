					I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
					in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

					“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
					transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
					for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
					The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
					the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

					Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
					learning from their experiences was easy.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
					gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
					junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
					an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”

					Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
					professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
					student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
					did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
					project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
					could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
					experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
					100% recommend! ”
